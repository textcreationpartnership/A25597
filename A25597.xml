            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ANSVVER To the LATE MEMORIAL OF THE Count D' Avaux, Ambaſſadour Extraordinary of FRANCE; IN A MEMORIAL Preſented to the States General, By the Marquiſs <hi>De Caſtell Moncayo,</hi> Envoy Extraordinary OF SPAIN On the 3d of <hi>MAY</hi> (84.) at the HAGUE.</head>
            <p>THe <hi>Marqueſs de Caſtell Moncayo,</hi> Envoy Extraordinary of <hi>Spain,</hi> has been at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> for the reaſon he declared in the laſt Conference, where he had the honour to concurr with the Deputies of your Lordſhips, and the Miniter of your High Allies; and being in company with the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs d'Grana,</hi> he received a Copy of the <hi>Memorial,</hi> which the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadour preſented to your Lordſhpis on the 29th paſt, &amp; they
<pb facs="tcp:106534:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>conſidering the Contents of the ſaid <hi>Memorial,</hi> reſolved that the <hi>Marqueſs d Caſtell Moncayo,</hi> ſhould forthwith return and make known to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, that the orders which the <hi>Marqueſs d'Grana,</hi> and the Extraordinary Envoy of <hi>Spain,</hi> have received from the King their Maſter, are ſuch as have been heretofore declared to your Lordſhips. to wit,</p>
            <p>Not to give ear to any unjuſt, unpracticable, or Artificial Propoſitions of <hi>France,</hi> nor to enter into Negotiation with them, but upon ſuch terms as are requiſite between Kings, Princes and Sovereigns of equal rank, and not to conclude any accommodation that is not warrantable and ſure in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, including all their Allies.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe Principles his Majeſty is reſolved to hazard the reſt of the Low Countryes, never to Yeild to have Laws Preſcribed him, unleſs compelled by Violence.</p>
            <p>The new Propoſitions that <hi>France</hi> makes to your Lordſhips, are more Arrogant and Unreaſonable then any hitherto delivered to your Lordſhips, and therefore they are ſtill the ſame, for this only deſign hath been and ſtill is to amuſe your Lordſhips, and to expoſe you to danger and render you unfaithful in your Treatys, and cauſe you to paſs in the Opinion of the World, as States of little foreſight, and to take from you intirely your Liberty, ſince the delay that <hi>France</hi> makes not to act on one ſide, while he beſieges a place as <hi>Luxemburg</hi> on the other, is but a new device, found for an Imaginary pretence of repoſe, which he hath made uſe of ſo long to ruin us by theſe kind of wayes.</p>
            <p>And therefore ſince your Lordſhips are not only to aſſiſt <hi>Spain</hi> in the Low Countrys, but alſo in any other place whatſoever, all the progreſs that <hi>France</hi> pretends to make upon <hi>Spain</hi> any where elſe, other then the Low Countries will feel its effects there, for which way ſoever the <hi>French</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quers the Low Countries, your Lordſhips will thereby immediately fall under the Slavery of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which the Subſcrib'd Envoy of <hi>Spain</hi> doubts not but that your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips know too well the rancour and venome couched in the <hi>Memorial</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> which cannot but be diſcerned by you: It's to be hoped that by the Aſſiſtance of the Good <hi>God,</hi> we may with United Forces prevent or repair the loſs of <hi>Luxemburg,</hi> aſſuring your Lordſhips again and again, that the Reſolutions of his Majeſty will be unalterable (come what will) ſince they have been taken purſuant to his Conſcience, Honour and Intereſt.</p>
